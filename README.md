# EyeFlow

EyeFlow is the cohort-analysis engine for retinal Doppler holography. It browses EyeFlow .h5 outputs, reads per-segment metrics, applies QC, compares models, and aggregates results at eye/cohort level (including artery–vein summaries) to help design biomarkers. It exports clean CSV reports for stats, figures, and clinical models.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher.
- It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

This project uses a `pyproject.toml` to describe all requirements needed. To start using it, **it is better to use a Python virtual environment (venv)**.

```sh
# Creates the venv
python -m venv .venv

# To enter the venv
# If you are using Windows PowerShell, you might need to activate the "Exceution" policy
./.venv/Scripts/activate
```

You can easily exit it with the command

```sh
deactivate
```

### 1. Basic Installation (User)

```sh
pip install -e .

# Installs pipeline-specific dependencies (optional)
pip install -e ".[pipelines]"
```

### 2. Development Setup (Contributor)

```sh
# Install all dependencies including dev tools (ruff, pre-commit, pyinstaller)
pip install -e ".[dev,pipelines]"

# Initialize pre-commit hooks (optionnal)
pre-commit install
```

> [!NOTE]
> The pre-commit is really usefull to run automatic checks before pushing code, reducing chances of ugly code being pushed.
>
> If a pre-commit hook fails, it will try to fix all needed files, **so you will need to add them again before recreating the commit**.

> [!TIP]
> You can run the linter easily, once the `dev` dependencies are installed, with the command:
>
> ```sh
> # To only run the checks
> lint-tool
>
> # To let the linter try to fix as much as possible
> lint-tool --fix
> ```

## Usage

Launch the main application to process files interactively:

### GUI

The GUI handles batch processing for folders, single .h5/.hdf5 files, or .zip archives and lets you run multiple pipelines at once. Batch outputs preserve the input subfolder layout under the chosen output directory (one combined `.h5` per input file).

Use the Pipeline Library tab to select which pipelines run. Selection preferences are saved per user between app launches, including installed builds.

```sh
# Via the entry point
eyeflow

# Or via the script
python src/eye_flow.py
```

When you run `eyeflow` from inside the repository checkout, the launcher prefers the local `src/` tree so newly added or edited pipelines are picked up without needing a full reinstall.

Installed builds expose an editable `pipelines/` folder next to `EyeFlow.exe`; use the Pipeline Library tab's Open folder and Reload buttons to edit and refresh it.

### CLI

The CLI is designed for batch processing in headless environments or clusters.

```sh
# Via the entry point
eyeflow-cli

# Or via the script
python src/cli.py
```

## Pipeline System

Pipelines are the heart of EyeFlow. To add a new analysis, create a file in `src/pipelines/` with a class inheriting from `ProcessPipeline`.

To register it to the app, add the decorator `@register_pipeline`. You can define any needed imports inside, as well as some more info.

To see more complete examples, check out `src/pipelines/basic_stats.py` and `src/pipelines/dummy_heavy.py`.

### Simple Pipeline Structure

```python
from pipelines import ProcessPipeline, ProcessResult, registerPipeline

@registerPipeline(
    name="My Analysis",
    description="Calculates a custom clinical metric.",
    required_deps=["torch>=2.2"],
)
class MyAnalysis(ProcessPipeline):
    def run(self, h5file):
        import torch
        # 1. Read data using h5py
        # 2. Perform calculations
        # 3. Return metrics

        metrics={"peak_flow": 12.5}

        # Optional attributes applied to the pipeline group.
        attrs = {
            "pipeline_version": "1.0",
            "author": "StaticExample"
        }

        return ProcessResult(
            metrics=metrics,
            attrs=attrs
        )
```
